			To encode the Dracula Film, I will be selecting and marking up segments of 1931 film transcript.
			In this marking up, I will make use of the &lt;sound&gt;, &lt;view&gt;, and &lt;camera&gt;
			tags to describe details that would not be obvious in the film's transcript alone.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to the film's transcript, I will link to images/frames from
			the film in which a description would not easily suffice.
		</p>
		<p>
			All segments I include, whether they be textual or visual, will link to a relevant theme in
			themes.xml. Along with each link, there will be a footnote (in an interpretation tag) with my analysis and why I included
			the segment in my mark up.
